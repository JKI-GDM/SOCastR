# Input Data Sets
The following data sets representing samples and corvriates for the German federal state Bavaria, which can be used for code excecution:

## Multi-scale Terrain Attributes and Sentinel-2 Bare Soil Composites 
Möller, M. (2025). Multi-scale Terrain Attributes and Sentinel-2 Bare Soil Composites for Digital Soil Mapping in Bavaria (1.0.0) [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17479135

## LUCAS 2018 Topsoil Database

This repository uses the LUCAS 2018 Topsoil database as the primary input data set for soil organic carbon (SOC) analyses and digital soil mapping. The LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey) survey provides harmonized, quality-controlled measurements of key soil properties across all EU member states and the UK.

### Data Description

The LUCAS 2018 Topsoil database contains:

- 18,984 geo-referenced soil samples from all EU countries and the UK
- Measurements of soil organic carbon (SOC), pH, CaCO₃, total nitrogen, texture, and other parameters
- Consistent sampling and laboratory analysis
- Associated metadata and spatial coordinates

For a comprehensive description of the dataset, data dictionary, and codebook, refer to the official data portal or Zenodo record:

### Source and Access

The LUCAS soil dataset is made available by the European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC):
- ESDAC data portal: https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/resource-type/datasets/lucas-2018-topsoil-data-distribution

Access to the full dataset requires acceptance of the terms of use and often a short registration.
